# Standardized Commit Messages

A tool to aid in standardizing commit messages. Based on this wonderful emoji based [standard Git Commit Message format](https://githumb.com/slashsBin/styleguide-git-commit-message) by @slashsBin.

## Setup

- Clone the repo
- Run `composer install`
- Set Git's file editor to use the included `bin/commit` with something like `export GIT_EDITOR=/your/path/to/commit-repo/bin/commit`
